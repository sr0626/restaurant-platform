"""Integration test: unauthenticated read access — tests/CLAUDE.md Phase 1
required coverage "Unauthed user can search and view listings" /
"Unauthed user cannot see deals".

Search itself (`GET /search`) is PostGIS-backed
(`search_service._fetch_candidates` calls real `ST_DWithin`/`ST_MakePoint`
SQL functions that don't exist on SQLite) and so cannot run against this
suite's SQLite fixture — see tests/integration/test_search_api.py, which
covers "unauthed user can search" against a real Postgres+PostGIS database
(guarded/skipped without one). This file covers the "and view listings"
half — `GET /restaurants/{id}`, `GET /restaurants/{id}/locations`,
`GET /locations/{id}` — plus confirming the public/private boundary itself
(an owner-only write route correctly rejects a request with no auth at
all).

"Unauthed user cannot see deals" is N/A for Phase 1: no `deal` model,
service, schema, or router exists anywhere in `backend/app/` on this
branch (root CLAUDE.md "Current Phase": "Do not build Phase 2 features
(payments, deals, analytics) during Phase 1" — deals are explicitly
Phase 2). There is nothing to call and nothing to assert; noted here and in
the QA report as not-applicable rather than silently dropped.
